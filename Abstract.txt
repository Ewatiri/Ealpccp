Equity African Leadership Programme College Counseling Portal (EALP CCP) DESCRIPTION

Each year the EALP college counseling team receives applications from scholars hoping to get admission to top colleges/universities through the team's guidance. The applications are then reviewed and the scholars who score highly are accepted into the program and the college preparation starts.
The EALP CCP was designed to help in this process.

The system is divided into two modules: Module 1 (Application Module) and Module 2 (College Preparation Module) and the users are divided into three categories:
a) Scholars
b) College Counselors (Mentors)
c) Head College Counselor 
The scholars are in charge of creating their own accounts and the accounts can only be created in the first module of the system before application submission is closed.
In the first module, their role is to complete and submit their applications. In the second module,they are expected to sign up for events, tests, upload test results and essays.
The essays are then reviewed by counselors.
The duties of the counselors in module one includes creating announcements,resources and reviewing the applications.
In the second module they pick their mentees (scholars), upload their scores, create events and review essays.
The head counselor is the overall head of the program and performs the same tasks as the mentors. On top of that he/she can also create counselor accounts and is incharge of switching the system between the modules.
